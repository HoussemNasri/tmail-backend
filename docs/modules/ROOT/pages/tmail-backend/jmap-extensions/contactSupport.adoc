= Contact Support
:navtitle: contact support

Reaching out to support is how most users resolve issues when encountering bugs, thus this action should be as accessible and reliable as possible.

This extension adds a new capability that wraps the configured support mail address and returns it as a property. This allows the frontend to dynamically present users with the most up-to-date support email whenever they need assistance.

== Additions to the capabilities object

Servers supporting the JMAP contact support extension need to advertise it through the session capabilities:
....
com:linagora:params:jmap:contact:support
....

The associated object have the following fields:

- `supportMailAddress`: *MailAddress*. The support mail address.
