= Contact Support
:navtitle: contact support

Reaching out to support is how most users resolve issues when encountering bugs, thus this action should be as accessible and reliable as possible.

This extension adds a new capability that wraps the configured support mail address and returns it as a property. This allows the frontend to dynamically present users with the most up-to-date support email whenever they need assistance.

== Additions to the capabilities object

Servers supporting the JMAP contact support extension need to advertise it through the session capabilities:
....
com:linagora:params:jmap:contact:support
....

The associated object have the following fields:

- `supportMailAddress`: *String|null*. The support mail address. Need to match addr-spec [@!RFC5322].

== Configuration

The support email address can be configured in the `jmap.properties` by setting the `support.mail.address` property.

Since this extension is optional, configuring it is also optional. If a valid configuration is not provided, the extension will be "disabled"â€”meaning the server will not advertise it as a supported capability.
